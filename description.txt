In this small project i have challenged my planning and problem solving skills
to simulate this cards war game.
ther is 2 decks of cards and each player flips a card
and whoever has the heighest card is going to win
and put all the cards into the pile then you flip over again.

used JavaScript and CSS to build a deck of cards game
